 - The kauth API has been removed. (50419013)
 /* After testing, I found that these Kauth interfaces are not really deleted, and Kemon still works. But I think this release note means that the door to the macOS kernel is closing. (08/28/2019) */

## What is Kemon?
An open-source Pre and Post callback-based framework for macOS kernel monitoring [1] [2].
With the power of Kemon, we can easily implement LPC communication monitoring, MAC policy filtering, kernel driver firewall, etc. In general, from an attacker's perspective, this framework can help achieve more powerful Rootkit. From the perspective of defense, Kemon can help construct more granular monitoring capabilities. I also implemented a kernel fuzzer [3] through this framework, which helped me find many vulnerabilities, such as: CVE-2017-7155, CVE-2017-7163, CVE-2017-13883 [4] and CVE-2018-4350, CVE-2018-4396, CVE-2018-4418 [5], etc.

## Supported Features
Kemon's features includeï¼š
- file operation monitoring
- process creation monitoring
- dynamic library and kernel extension monitoring
- network traffic monitoring
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy monitoring, etc.

In addition, Kemon project can also extend the Pre and Post callback-based monitoring interfaces for any macOS kernel function.

## Getting Started
### How to build the Kemon driver
